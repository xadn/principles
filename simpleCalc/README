edit: fixed bug in expression grammar statement that broke the order of operations

-OVERVIEW
The goal of this project is to learn how to use Bison and Flex together. The simpleCalc program parses input from a file or stdin and performs mathematical operations.

-REQUIREMENTS
Correct precedence for * and +
Accept floats or ints
Allow variable name
Accept program of expressions
Read from file

-USAGE
./simpleCalc <optional: filename>

-INCLUDED FILES
Makefile - run 'make' to compile the .l and .y files into the simpleCalc executable, probably only works on *nix systems

simpleCalc.l - input file for flex, parses the input stream

simpleCalc.y - input file for bison, defines the grammar and actions

testfile - a input file for simpleCalc to test the file reading capabilities
